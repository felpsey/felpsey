# [Ethan Phelps](https://felpsey.com)
A natural passion for education, software, and engineering with a meticulous and compulsive desire to achieve.

## Experience
I have worked in the IT industry from the age of 17 primarily supporting internal ITIL aligned service desks and technical operations for managed service providers.
A consistent theme during my employment has been the concious selection of roles that support the public sector, including primary, secondary, higher education, NHS and UK Government.
